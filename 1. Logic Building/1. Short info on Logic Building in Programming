Logic Building in Programming

Logic building is the skill of crafting structured, step-by-step solutions to problems using fundamental principles. 
It forms the foundation of programming — allowing developers to think critically, break down challenges, and develop efficient solutions just like we approach problems in everyday life.

How to Improve Your Programming Logic

1) Grasp the Problem Clearly:

Before jumping into code, take time to fully understand what the problem is asking. Misinterpreting the question leads to incorrect solutions.

2) Create Sample Test Cases:

Think of different input scenarios — including edge cases — and try to predict the expected output. 
This sharpens your understanding of the problem.

3) Spot Patterns and Insights:

Analyze your test cases to uncover patterns or relationships. These observations often lead to optimized logic.

4) Start Simple, Then Optimize:

Begin with the most straightforward solution, even if it's not the most efficient. Once it works, look for ways to make it faster or cleaner.
